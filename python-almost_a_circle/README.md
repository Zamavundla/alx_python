# AirBnB Project Readme

Welcome to the AirBnB project! This project is a crucial part of the Higher level curriculum and aims to prepare you for various aspects of Python programming. By completing this project, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of fundamental Python concepts as well as more advanced topics. 

## Project Overview

In this project, you will cover the following Python concepts:

- Importing modules
- Handling exceptions
- Working with classes
- Utilizing private attributes
- Implementing getter and setter methods
- Defining class methods and static methods
- Exploring inheritance
- Writing unit tests
- Reading and writing files

Additionally, you will delve into the following topics:

- Using *args and **kwargs
- Serialization and deserialization of objects
- Understanding JSON format

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to confidently explain the following concepts without needing external references:

### General
- The purpose and implementation of unit testing in large projects
- How to serialize and deserialize a Python class
- Reading from and writing to JSON files
- Usage of *args to handle variable-length arguments in functions
- Utilizing **kwargs to handle keyword arguments in functions

## Requirements

### Python Scripts
- You are allowed to use Visual Studio Code as your code editor.
- All your code files will be interpreted and compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.4.3).
- Make sure that all your code files end with a new line.
- The project folder must contain a `README.md` file at the root level.
- Adhere to the PEP 8 style guide (version 1.7.*) for code formatting.
- The length of your code files will be tested using the `wc` command.
- Properly document all your Python modules using the following command:
  ```
  python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'
  ```
- Document all your classes using the following command:
  ```
  python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'
  ```
- Thoroughly document your functions, both inside and outside of classes, using these commands:
  ```
  python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'
  python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'
  ```
- Remember, documentation should be descriptive sentences that explain the purpose of the module, class, or method.

## Additional Resources

To excel in this project, it's recommended to read or watch the following materials:

- Understand the usage of `*args` and `**kwargs`
- Familiarize yourself with JSON encoding and decoding
- Learn about the `unittest` module for Python testing
- Refer to the Python test cheatsheet for effective testing practices

Good luck with your AirBnB project journey! Upon completing this project, you'll have a solid grasp of Python programming concepts and practices.
